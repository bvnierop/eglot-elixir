* eglot-elixir

Automatically download, install and keep up to date elixir-ls
(https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls) and set it up for use with eglot.

Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; After eglot is loaded
(require 'eglot-elixir)
#+END_SRC

This sets eglot up to use this packages' ~eglot-elixir~ function as startup
function for eglot for the ~elixir-mode~ major mode.

For the first run, eglot should be started manually by executing ~M-x eglot~ in
an ~elixir-mode~ buffer.
